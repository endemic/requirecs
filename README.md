RequireJS + CoffeeScript + Backbone.js
======================================

Basic project structure using RequireJS, CoffeeScript, and Backbone.js. Write Backbone views, instantiate them in **app.coffee**, 
then switch between them by triggering a _scene:change_ event. Ostensibly used for simple DOM-based games. If you use percentage-based CSS 
to style your app, you can enforce a 2:3 resolution-independent aspect ratio.
